# LogRoyale

LogRoyale is an interactive acitvity logger for the popular mobile game Clash Royale.

This application uses data from RoyaleAPI to log player activity data into an SQL database.

This data can then be displayed and interacted with via the LogRoyale website.

Note the following:
* This project will not work unless the SQL database is properly configured using the provided royaledatabaseSetUp.sql file.
* This project will not work unless you change the API key with your own API key obtained through the RoyaleAPI developers website.
* Some lines of code relating to the SQL server connection found in the scripts and website folders may need changed based on the set up of your machine and SQL server.
* No official, live website exists for LogRoayle (yet)
